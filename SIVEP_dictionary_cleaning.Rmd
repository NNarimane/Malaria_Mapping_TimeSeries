# SIVEP - Epidemiological Surveillance Information System
This file was done to share details of SIVEP variables and register all dropped variables and modifications we did on kept variables.  
  
## SIVEP time and space resolution  

SIVEP started in 2003 January. We have complete data from 2003 to 2017 and initial months of 2018. The database has entries, permitting to aggregate into **daily case numbers** (reported date in year/month/day) and **epidemiological week**. These can later be aggregated to a different temporal resolution if needed.   

### Spatial resolution  
SIVEP is database for malaria notification that is mandatory in Brazil. Before 2003, the database was named SISMAL, which was a different database in relation to variables and categories.  

Each notification is associated with a federal unity, municipality, zone type (urban/rural) and a locality, which gives a finer resolution. Localities might be on the size of census tract or, more generally, smaller. Information from localities can be linked to IBGE census. SIVEP database has a complementary databe with localities information. This information will be listed below.

## Confirmation of malaria cases
Cases in Brazil are mostly confirmed by microscopy. The detection is of three types: passive, active and LVC (Cure Verification Thick Smear). **Passive case detection** corresponds to a diagnosis done when an individual looks for health assistance. **Active case detection** corresponds to a diagnosis done by a screening after finding a case. The protocol is described as an active search, when a case is reported, such that the neighboorhood around 1 km radius is investigated. LVC cases are notifications done when individuals return to health units. We still need to investigate more about numbers of LVC cases.  

## Treatment data     
SIVEP provides the **treatment schema for reported cases**. Completeness is > 85% and after 2011, > 95%. We have just requested more information about it, because is in a complementary database.

### Removing variables  
**Obs.**: RES_EXAM = 0 happens only in 2003 in 17 entries. I removed because this category does not exist.  
```{r}
#df <- df %>% 
      # select(-DT_ENVLO, -DT_DIGIT, -SEM_NOTI, -COD_UNIN, -COD_AGEN, -RACA, -GESTANTE1, -NIV_ESCO_1, -ESQUEMA_1, -HEMOPARASI, -EXAME_, -EXAMINADOR, -VIVAX, -FALCIPARUM) %>% 
      # filter(RES_EXAM == "2" | RES_EXAM == "3" | RES_EXAM == "4" | RES_EXAM == "5" | RES_EXAM == "6" | RES_EXAM == "7" | RES_EXAM == "9")

df <- df %>% 
      select(-DT_ENVLO, -DT_DIGIT, -SEM_NOTI, -COD_AGEN, -GESTANTE1, -NIV_ESCO_1, -ESQUEMA_1, -HEMOPARASI, -EXAME_, -EXAMINADOR, -VIVAX, -FALCIPARUM) %>% 
      filter(RES_EXAM == "2" | RES_EXAM == "3" | RES_EXAM == "4" | RES_EXAM == "5" | RES_EXAM == "6" | RES_EXAM == "7" | RES_EXAM == "9")


```

### Filtering and grouping to falciparum and vivax types.
RES_EXAM categories:  
2 - Falciparum    
3 - F+FG    
4 - Vivax    
5 - F+V  
6 - V+FG   
7 - FG    
8 - Malariae    
9 - F+M    
10 – Ovale    
11 – Não F      


- Categorizing variables and transforming to factor.
```{r}
df <- df %>% 
      mutate(RES_EXAM = if_else(RES_EXAM == "2" | RES_EXAM == "3" | RES_EXAM == "7" | RES_EXAM == "9", "F", 
                                if_else(RES_EXAM == "4" | RES_EXAM == "6", "V",

                                                        if_else(QTD_CRUZ == "5", "+++",

                              if_else(TIPO_LAM == "2", "ACD", "CV")))

             COD_OCUP = as.factor(COD_OCUP),
             NIV_ESCO = as.factor(NIV_ESCO),
             TIPO_LAM = factor(TIPO_LAM, c("PCD", "ACD", "CV"), c("PCD", "ACD", "CV"))
             )

levels(df$SEXO)

```

## Adding AGE RANGE

### Creating the continuos age by year and after by categories (age range) from IBGE
- Continuos age in year: here I dropped registries with inconsistency.
```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  filter(ID_PACIE < 30 & ID_DIMEA == "D" | ID_PACIE < 12 & ID_DIMEA == "M" | ID_PACIE <= 100 & ID_DIMEA == "A")

df$ID_PACIE <- as.double(df$ID_PACIE) 

df <- df %>% 
          mutate(AGE_CONT = if_else(ID_DIMEA == "A", ID_PACIE, 0))
```

- Age range

```{r}
df$AGE_CAT <- NA 
df[which(df$AGE_CONT <= 4),]$AGE_CAT <- "0-4"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 5 & df$AGE_CONT <= 9),]$AGE_CAT <- "5-9"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 10 & df$AGE_CONT <= 14),]$AGE_CAT <- "10-14"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 15 & df$AGE_CONT <= 19),]$AGE_CAT <- "15-19"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 20 & df$AGE_CONT <= 24),]$AGE_CAT <- "20-24"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 25 & df$AGE_CONT <= 29),]$AGE_CAT <- "25-29"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 30 & df$AGE_CONT <= 34),]$AGE_CAT <- "30-34"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 35 & df$AGE_CONT <= 39),]$AGE_CAT <- "35-39"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 40 & df$AGE_CONT <= 44),]$AGE_CAT <- "40-44"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 45 & df$AGE_CONT <= 49),]$AGE_CAT <- "45-49"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 50 & df$AGE_CONT <= 54),]$AGE_CAT <- "50-54"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 55 & df$AGE_CONT <= 59),]$AGE_CAT <- "55-59"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 60 & df$AGE_CONT <= 64),]$AGE_CAT <- "60-64"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 65 & df$AGE_CONT <= 69),]$AGE_CAT <- "65-69"

df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 75 & df$AGE_CONT <= 79),]$AGE_CAT <- "75-79"
df[which(df$AGE_CONT >= 80),]$AGE_CAT <- "80+"

df$AGE_CAT = factor(df$AGE_CAT, label=c("0-4","5-9","10-14","15-19","20-24","25-29","30-34","35-39","40-44","45-49","50-54","55-59","60-64","65-69","70-74","75-79","80+"), levels= c("0-4","5-9","10-14","15-19","20-24","25-29","30-34","35-39","40-44","45-49","50-54","55-59","60-64","65-69","70-74","75-79","80+"))

### Localities data availabilty in IBGE
- Example of Acre state  
IBGE database has information for census tract, zone (urban or rural), macro, meso and micro regions, municipality and state. The finest resolution to calculate the API is for zone. For locality we have to use population size provided by SIVEP, that can be very outdated depends on the municipality.    
```{r}
l2 <- fread("/home/claudia/Documentos/Doutorado/Desenvolvimento/Dados/Shapes/IBGE/Base_informacoes_setores2010_universo_AC/Base informaçoes setores2010 universo AC/CSV/Basico_AC.csv", sep2 = ";", encoding = "Latin-1", stringsAsFactors = F)

class(l2$Cod_setor)
unique(l2$Cod_setor)

l2$Cod_setor <- as.integer(l2$Cod_setor)

### Variables doubts list
1- Severe malaria: what means? About medicines, hospitalizations?  
2- Pregnant women using Primaquine  
3- TIPO_LAM and LVC- why LVC is decreasing during the years? What's the criteria to fill?  
4- How they fill date of 1st symptoms, date of exam and treatment: many problems about the difference in days.   
5- What is CODSEI and COPOBASE from locality database? I didn't find on the locality database dictionary.  
6- What is SMS acronym founded in some explanations in loc database?
7- The variable about occupation has the category "Others" that has an expressive number of the registry. How is this category filled in? What kind of occupation is included in this category?
